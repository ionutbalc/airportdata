	    <p>As of February 2009, the OpenFlights Airports Database contains <b>5391</b> airports spanning the globe, as shown in the map above.  Each entry contains the following information:</p>

	    <table>
		<tr>

		  <td class="data">Name of airport.  May or may not contain the <b>City</b> name.</td>

	    <p>The data is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) encoded, with no special characters.</p>

	    <p><i>Note</i>: Rules for daylight savings time change from year to year and from country to country.  The current data is an approximation for 2009, built on a country level.  Most airports in DST-less regions in countries that generally observe DST (eg. AL, HI in the USA, NT, QL in Australia, parts of Canada) are marked incorrectly.</p>

	    <h2>Airline database</h2>

	    <p>As of February 2009, the OpenFlights Airlines Database contains <b>5971</b> airlines.  Each entry contains the following information:</p>

	    <p>The data is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) encoded.  The special value <b>\N</b> is used for "NULL" to indicate that no value is available, and is understood automatically by MySQL if imported.</p>
	    <p><i>Notes</i>: Airlines with null codes/callsigns/countries generally represent user-added airlines.  Since the data is intended primarily for current flights, defunct IATA codes are generally not included.  For example, "Sabena" is not listed with a SN IATA code, since "SN" is presently used by its successor Brussels Airlines.</p>

	      <li>Routes where one carrier operates both its own and codeshare flights are listed twice.  These can be filtered out with the UNIX command <tt>uniq -w 10 &lt;routes.dat &gt;routes2.dat</tt>.
