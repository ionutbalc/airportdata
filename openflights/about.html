	    <h1>About</h1>
	    
	    <p>OpenFlights is a tool that lets you map your flights around the world, search and filter them in all sorts of interesting ways, and calculate statistics automatically.  It's also the name of the open-source project to build the tool.  Read more about it in the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.</p>

	    <p>OpenFlights is presently in <b>ALPHA</b> &mdash; that means it's a demonstration of what's to come, not a usable product. Beta testing before it really goes live is in progress, and if you'd like to be informed about when it's ready to launch, drop us a line at info at openflights dot org.</p>
